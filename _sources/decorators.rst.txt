Route decorators
================

Authentication
--------------

Used in the controller over the functions to validate different user permissions.

* **jwt_required** *

Validate that the user has a valid jwt token.

* **admin_required** *

Validate that the user has the admin role.

This could eventually be changed to validate that the user's role is included in a role array for that route.
